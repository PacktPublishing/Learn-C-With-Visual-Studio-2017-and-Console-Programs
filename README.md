# Learn C# With Visual Studio 2017 and Console Programs [Video]
This is the code repository for Learn C# With Visual Studio 2017 and Console Programs [Video](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-c-visual-studio-2017-and-console-programs-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This course consists of standalone examples designed to illustrate specific skills. There are no big applications built in this course. You must use Visual Studio 2017 to be sure you have the latest version of C# running. Lower versions of Visual Studio will cause errors because newer programming elements will not be found. This is a beginners course, but it is still detailed, even when it's very technical. This means in a few videos the author shows you the .NET framework source code. He does this because it's important to look at things as they actually are, and not at an artificially simplified perspective. This course covers C# through console programs only. It does not have ASP.NET, Windows forms, MVC, .NET core or anything like that. The videos are just coding videos done in Visual Studio Community 2017. This is the free version of Visual Studio. This is a course dedicated to code only, so you do not see any of the following: a talking head, PowerPoints or fancy graphics. All the code is written from scratch in the code editor window in Visual Studio Community 2017.
